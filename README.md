# graphs

This repository is currently a sandbox for mathematical investigations into exceptional structures and dynamics on graphs.

The studies will be inspired by the concepts  covered in Norman J. Wildberger's  [Wild Egg Maths ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCriFv3G22iOUidUhkIGXuhw) channel on youtube.

The first exercise on the mutation game can be found here:
